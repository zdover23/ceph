Vulnerability Management Process
================================

#. The report will be acknowledged within three business days or less.
#. The team will investigate and update the email thread with relevant
   information and may ask for additional information or guidance
   surrounding the reported issue.
#. If the team does not confirm the report, no further action will be
   taken and the issue will be closed.
#. If the team confirms the report, a unique CVE identifier will be
   assigned and shared with the reporter. The team will take action to
   fix the issue.
#. If a reporter has no disclosure date in mind, a Ceph security team
   member will coordinate a release date (CRD) with the list members
   and share the mutually agreed disclosure date with the reporter.
#. The vulnerability disclosure / release date is set excluding Friday and
   holiday periods.
#. Embargoes are preferred for Critical and High impact
   issues. Embargo should not be held for more than 90 days from the
   date of vulnerability confirmation, except under unusual
   circumstances. For Low and Moderate issues with limited impact and
   an easy workaround or where an issue that is already public, a
   standard patch release process will be followed to fix the
   vulnerability once CVE is assigned.
#. Medium and Low severity issues will be released as part of the next
   standard release cycle, with at least a 7 days advanced
   notification to the list members prior to the release date. The CVE
   fix details will be included in the release notes, which will be
   linked in the public announcement.
#. A private repository will be used to review and test commits that address
   security vulnerabilities. A new patch version will be released from this
   private repository when the process of reviewing and testing is complete.
#. If a vulnerability is unintentionally already fixed in the public
   repository, a few days are given to downstream stakeholders/vendors
   to prepare for updating before the public disclosure.
#. An announcement will be made disclosing the vulnerability. The
   fastest place to receive security announcements is via the
   `ceph-announce@ceph.io <ceph-announce@ceph.io>`_ or
   `oss-security@lists.openwall.com <oss-security@lists.openwall.com>`_ mailing
   lists.  (These lists are low-traffic).

If the report is considered embargoed, we ask you to not disclose the
vulnerability before it has been fixed and announced, unless you
received a response from the Ceph security team that you can do
so. This holds true until the public disclosure date that was agreed
upon by the list. Thank you for improving the security of Ceph and its
ecosystem. Your efforts and responsible disclosure are greatly
appreciated and will be acknowledged.
