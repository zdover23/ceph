Introduction
============

This guide has two aims:

#. to make it easier for software developers to get involved in the Ceph
   project.
#. to serve as a reference for Ceph developers.

This guide has been written with the assumption that its readers are familiar
with Ceph. If you believe that you do not know enough about Ceph to read this
guide, refer to the `project website`_ and pay special attention to  the
`publications list`_.  Another way to learn about what's happening in Ceph is
to check out our `youtube channel`_ , where we post Tech Talks, Code
walk-throughs and Ceph Developer Monthly recordings.

This Developer Guide contains links to documentation both within the Ceph
documentation and elsewhere on the web.  If you notice that a link is broken or
you can suggest a link to a better resource than one currently in this
Developer Guide, `report it as a bug`_.
